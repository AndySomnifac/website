This section contains reef-pi specific guides that are not specific to any builds. Some of these (e.g Installing & Configuring reef-pi) are pre-requisite for all build guides, while others (e.g. Touchscreen setup, Troubleshooting ) are for things that ar not a must, but can be useful for any reef-pi based controllers.
